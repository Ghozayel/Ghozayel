### Hi there 👋

I'm Gzyl, a short of Ghozayel. I've a strong passion for using R for data-analysis, R-packages and beyond!
- 🌱 I'm the author and maintainer of my 1st R-Package 'Lextale', details can be accessed in my repo. 
- 🔭 I'm currently a senior PhD student, University of Nottingham, UK; a quantitative linguist interested in psycholinguitics, corpus linguistics, language aquisition, cross-linguistic studies & input-modality. 
- 🔭 I'm a lecturer in Jubail Industrial College, Saudi.
- I've experience of using PsychoPy, Pavlovia and GitLab for running studies online.
- Besides R, I'm currently working on improving my Python language ⚡
- 💬 Ask me about statistics for linguists using R, running studies using PsychoPy, and creating R packages from scratch 😄.
- 📫 How to reach me: @gzl_atb
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like lemons
